### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    I loved lab 3 part 1 since we were able to ask the peoole to input numbers
    and then it would be able to calculate the BMR of the person which
    I think is really cool. I also liked this lab since my lab mate and I
    communicated really well and were able to help eachother out a lot. 
    I learned how to calculate different BMR's for different people and 
    how different they are for everyone. 

* Lab 7

    I really liked lab 7 it was only 1 part but they way we had to figure 
    out how to make the time slots show that they were or werent able to 
    park was cool. Me and my lab partner were brainstorming on how to make 
    the time slots work and it was fun. We were able to figure out what
    restricions we needed so that the people would know if they were able 
    to park there or not. 

* Lab 10 

    This for me was the most intresting labs since we were able to code
    something that went through different counties and get their name 
    and population. I learned how to loop through a list and get the 
    name of that and match it to one given by the user. I liked this one
    since me and my lab mate really tried and were able to figure it out 
    in the end.
